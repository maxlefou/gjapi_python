This is a script that lets you use Game Jolt trophies and scoring in your Ren'Py games. It's originally a python script modified so it can be understood by the Ren'Py engine.
You can find a sample game [that uses it here](https://gitlab.com/maxlefou/GameJolt_API_for_RenPy_Sample_Game). If you are new with python and Ren'Py coding, I suggest you to get an eye on the sample game's code while [reading the wiki](https://github.com/maxlefou/gjapi_renpy/wikis/home). You can also get the sample game compiled in the url [here](http://gamejolt.com/games/game-jolt-api-for-ren-py-sample-game/127112). 

Simply drop the .rpy file with the other rpy files of your project. Then, you have the instructions on how to use it in [the wiki](https://gitlab.com/maxlefou/gjapi_renpy/wikis/REN'PY-Documentation-Reference).
